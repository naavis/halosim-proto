Ice Crystal Halo Simulator
==========================

Single-threaded CPU-implementation of a halo simulator designed to visualize different halo phenomena
resulting from sunlight hitting hexagonal ice crystals in the atmosphere.
This is just a crude prototype to facilitate developing a more polished and parallelized simulator later on.
